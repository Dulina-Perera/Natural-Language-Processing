Cognitive Analytics Cognition is the mental action or process of acquiring knowledge by understanding true thought experience and the senses
Cognitive Analytics Cognitive processes use existing knowledge and generate new knowledge
Cognitive Analytics The Purpose of cognitive computing is to perform tasks that only humans used to be able to do
Cognitive Analytics It augments human capabilities (As opposed to AI which just automates)

Cognitive Analytics Cognitive analytics reveals certain patterns and connections that simple analytics cannot
Cognitive Analytics Cognitive computing allows a wide variety of problems previously incapable of being solved by fixed program instructions to be calculable and estimable
Cognitive Analytics Cognitive analytics can be thought of as analytics with human-like intelligence applied to certain tasks and brings together a number of intelligent technologies including Semantics
Cognitive Analytics Cognitive analytics can be thought of as analytics with human-like intelligence applied to certain tasks and brings together a number of intelligent technologies including Artificial intelligence algorithms
Cognitive Analytics Cognitive analytics can be thought of as analytics with human-like intelligence applied to certain tasks and brings together a number of intelligent technologies including Deep learning
Cognitive Analytics Cognitive analytics can be thought of as analytics with human-like intelligence applied to certain tasks and brings together a number of intelligent technologies including Machine learning
Cognitive Analytics This allows a cognitive application to improve over time

Cognitive Analytics It uses several visual perceptions speech recognition decision-making and NLP (Natural Language Processing) concepts to make sense of previously untapped data from rich sources such as conversational logs feedback reviewssocial media and so on
Cognitive Analytics Applying such techniques a cognitive application can get smarter and more effective over time by (self) learning from its interactions with data and with humans
Cognitive Analytics Inferences are not structured queries based on a rules database rather could be unstructured hypotheses gathered from several data sources and expressed with varying degrees of confidence level

Cognitive Analytics Cognitive Analytics is intelligent technology that covers multiple analytical techniques to analyze large data sets and give structure to the unstructured data
Cognitive Analytics Cognitive analytics system searches through the data that exists in its knowledge base to find solutions that make sense for the questions posed
Cognitive Analytics A cognitive system can create competitive advantage to business providing real-time answers with the ability to Search through massive amounts of information
Cognitive Analytics A cognitive system can create competitive advantage to business providing real-time answers with the ability to Making sense of context and meaning of a sentence
Cognitive Analytics A cognitive system can create competitive advantage to business providing real-time answers with the ability to Computing the most likely answer
Cognitive Analytics A cognitive system can create competitive advantage to business providing real-time answers with the ability to Recognizing certain objects in an image given large amounts of information

Cognitive Analytics An organization might use cognitive analytics to monitor their customer behavior patterns and emerging trends This way the organization can predict future outcomes and plan their objectives accordingly to improve their performance
Cognitive Analytics Some sections of cognitive analytics also fall under predictive analytics where data in business intelligence is used to make predictions

How Does Cognitive Computing Work? Adaptive Flexible systems which learn as information changes in tandem with the evolution of goals and requirements
How Does Cognitive Computing Work? Adaptive Cognitive applications must be adaptive in nature
How Does Cognitive Computing Work? Adaptive Capable of integrating latest or frequently changing data feeds like real-time or near real-time to master ambiguity and unpredictability
How Does Cognitive Computing Work? Interactive The cognitive system must be able to interact easily with users so that users can define their needs comfortably
How Does Cognitive Computing Work? Interactive Similarly it must also interact with other processors devices and Cloud services

How Does Cognitive Computing Work? Iterative Iterative process to solve problems which are ambiguous
How Does Cognitive Computing Work? Iterative The system should remember previous interactions in a process
How Does Cognitive Computing Work? Iterative It should be able to define the problem by asking questions or finding an additional source
How Does Cognitive Computing Work? Iterative For this ensure that the cognitive system is always provided with enough validated quality information and that the data sources it operates are reliable and up to date
How Does Cognitive Computing Work? Stateful The system should return information that is suitable for the specific application at that point in time

How Does Cognitive Computing Work? Contextual Cognitive applications should be able to understand identify and extract contextual elements such as meaning syntax time location appropriate domain process task and goal
How Does Cognitive Computing Work? Contextual It must draw on multiple sources of information including both structured and unstructured digital information
How Does Cognitive Computing Work? Dark Data Compatibility Cognitive computing systems should be able to deal with “dark data” such as social media postings EMR notes fitness device readings unstructured images videos and the digital or non-digital documents generated by users in day to day life
How Does Cognitive Computing Work? Dark Data Compatibility Cognitive Computing applications process such multi-structured and unstructured dark data along with structured information to pull out non-obvious insights and subject it to analytics

Real-Life Applications of Cognitive Analytics The medical industry is now starting to use cognitive analytics to match its patients with the best possible treatments
Real-Life Applications of Cognitive Analytics Some examples of cognitive analytics which are in use today include Microsoft’s Cortana Apple’s Siri and IBM’s Watson
Real-Life Applications of Cognitive Analytics Organizations are using cognitive analytics to tap into unstructured data sources such as images emails text documents and social posts
Real-Life Applications of Cognitive Analytics Though cognitive analytics is still in its infancy it may be the solution to finding real-time answers for large amounts of diverse data and bringing a paradigm shift from traditional analytics
